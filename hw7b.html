    <h1>Shaping Content Around Image</h1>
    <h2>Shaping around the house</h2>    
        <p>
            <img src="/images/house.png" alt="house">    
            This is a paragraph that will start on the right side of the house shape and the CSS substituted the float of the image (the house.png) to use the CSS Shapes properties. 
            This page was modified for that purpose and you will see that these two paragraphs will then follow the shape of that house following any curve, or diagonal liine you see 
            instead of just following a rectangular shape of the width and height of the image. Next will be the start of the second paragraph to see where the text will warp around 
            the house image and how the image will stay in the same position.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the start of the second paragraph and this paragrahp will also shape the house and the second paragraph is here just to show you that it will follow the shape of
            the house until the shape ends then the content will align as it is the default of the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the third paragraph and, by now, I am not sure if this paragraph will be written on the right side of the image or the paragraph has been placed below the image starting 
            on the left side of the browser and being normally displayed as any other element of a web page.
