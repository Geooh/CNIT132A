  <h1>Google Analytics Report | Homework 8 Part 2</h1>

  <div class="container-hw8part2">
    <p>My website's Google Analytics report can be found 
      with this <a href="./images/Google_Analytics_report.pdf" style="color: rgb(255, 143, 91);">Link</a></p>
    <p>The Google Analytics report is taken from the dates of February 15th to May 14th, 2024. The website has gained fourteen new users within this time frame and the average engagement time 
      is roughly around three minutes. This would assume that each new user was exploring the entirety of the website. All the new registered users have found this website by the direct method, 
      and that is due to users either typing or copying/pasting the direct URL link and accessing it in that manner.</p>

      <p>An interesting note of the users that visited the website, one of them has visited from Vietnam which was unexpected for sure, but nonetheless its very interesting to learn about that.
      The user activity seems to be in line because for the past few weeks our assignments have been focused on more CSS practices so the decline in visitors seems plausible. Where we can get the most information is the Views page because 
      weâ€™re able to determine which portion of the whole website was visited most frequently, which can help us focus more on those areas and improve them either visually or improve quality of life within those pages.</p>  
   
    <p>Using Google Analytics and going over the data it has saved has given me significant insight into how traffic goes to my website. All this data can definitely assist me into thinking how I could improve my website as a whole.</p>
